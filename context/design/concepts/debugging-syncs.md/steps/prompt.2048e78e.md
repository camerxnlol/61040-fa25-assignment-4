# prompt: Write a short piazza post questioning the role of queries and if all queries should be public since the engine/sync.ts handles them differently. My intended behavior is to make a sync for the queries like we would for any of the other actions (one for request, one for response, one for error). Give the \_getFriends example from the code.
