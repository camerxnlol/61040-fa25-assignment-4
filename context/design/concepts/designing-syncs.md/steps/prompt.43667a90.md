# prompt: Before on my frontend I would just query the endpoints directly, but now it goes through requesting. Sometimes this adds an extra layer to the return. For example in \_getRankings, the response would be in data then rankedSongs\[] but now it is in data then in rankings then in rankedSongs\[] are these one level deep nests expected when going through the requesting concept? Be concise.
